Flex SDK is required to compile AS3 code into an SWF or AIR file.

It's somewhat hard to get Flex SDK working these days using old sources. 
Specifically because the Apache Flex SDK installers no longer work. 
In theory you should still be able to get things set up by using the zip 
downloads provided by Apache Flex and/or Harman.


Included here is a working Windows binary release of Apache Flex SDK 4.16.1.
