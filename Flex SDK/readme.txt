Flex SDK is required to compile AS3 code into an SWF or AIR file.

It's somewhat hard to get Flex SDK working these days using old sources. 
Specifically because the Apache Flex SDK installers no longer seem to work. 
In theory you should still be able to get things set up by using the zip 
downloads provided by Apache Flex and/or Harman.


Included here is a working Windows binary release of Apache Flex SDK 4.16.1.

Note that if you want to be able to build AIR apps as well as SWF files, you
will need to download an AIR SDK package from https://airsdk.harman.com/download.
Choose "AIR SDK for Flex Developers - to be overlaid onto a Flex SDK" and extract
the AIR SDK into the same directory that you chose for Flex SDK.
